				<h2>Outside the Vehicle</h2>
				<div class="main_info">
					<p>Always bring your child with you when you exit the vehicle &mdash; no amount of time is safe to leave your child unattended in the vehicle, even for &ldquo;just a minute&rdquo;, and it is illegal to do so in some states.</p>
					<p>Be sure that you lock the vehicle&rsquo;s doors and trunk after exiting with your child &mdash; even when parked and at home, a vehicle can endanger a child, as they can become trapped within it if left open.</p>
					<p>Instruct children that the vehicle is not a safe place to play.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>In General</h2>
				<div class="main_info">
					<p>Familiarize yourself with life&dash;saving techniques such as the Heimlich Maneuver, child cardiopulmonary resuscitation &lpar;CPR&rpar;, and other first&dash;aid measures, and call 911 for emergencies.</p>
					<p>Be sure your child&rsquo;s caretaker&lpar;s&rpar; are aware of the dangers and solutions, and always have a plan of action in case of emergency.</p>
					<p>Be aware of your child&rsquo;s behavior and condition: if they are acting strange or confused, or if they are exhibiting nausea, dizziness, sudden cessation of sweating, or quick/slow pulse, they may be suffering heat stroke.</p>
