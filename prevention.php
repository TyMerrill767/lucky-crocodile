				<h2>Outside the Vehicle</h2>
				<div class="main_info">
					<p>Always bring your child with you when you exit the vehicle – no amount of time is safe to leave your child unattended in the vehicle, even for “just a minute”, and it is illegal to do so in some states</p>
					<p>Be sure that you lock the vehicle’s doors and trunk after exiting with your child – even when parked and at home, a vehicle can endanger a child, as they can become trapped within it if left open</p>
					<p>Instruct children that the vehicle is not a safe place to play</p>
				</div>

				<h2>In General</h2>
				<div class="main_info">
					<p>Familiarize yourself with life-saving techniques such as the Heimlich Maneuver, child cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and other first-aid measures, and call 911 for emergencies.</p>
					<p>Be sure your child's caretaker(s) are aware of the dangers and solutions, and always have a plan of action in case of emergency.</p>
					<p>Be aware of your child's behavior and condition: if they are acting strange or confused, or if they are exhibiting nausea, dizziness, sudden cessation of sweating, or quick/slow pulse, they may be suffering heat stroke.</p>
